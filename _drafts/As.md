This day and age we&#8217;re living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like forth dimension.

Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein&#8217;s theory.  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension

And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed.]

You must remember this  
A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by.

And when two lovers woo  
They still say, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by.

Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date.  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate.  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny.

It&#8217;s still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die.  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by.

Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by.
